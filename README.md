- 👋 Hi, I’m @cricecc
- 👀 Vision: Building an intuitive voice and text-based control system for cars that merges native in-car systems with external services using LLMs. The goal is to reduce the complexity of modern vehicle interfaces, making driving as intuitive and simple as possible. We aim to create an experience where drivers can focus on the joy of driving—similar to the ease of operating a golf cart—by minimizing distractions and allowing for effortless control of key settings.

- ❗️Problem: Current in-car systems are too complex, leading to poor user experiences.
- ✅ Solution: An intuitive, voice/text-first control system that anticipates needs and actions using LLMs.
- 🌐 Technologies: OpenAI API, SiriKit, Apple CarPlay/Android Auto, Python, in-car hardware systems... 
- 💞️ I’m looking for people to teach me how...
- Key Use Cases:
Key Use Cases:
1. Instant Driver Personalization Upon Entry: When the driver enters the car, the system immediately personalizes settings like seat position, mirrors, and climate control based on their profile.
Key Features:
Automatic profile recognition (via voice or smartphone authentication).
Adjustments for seat, mirrors, climate, and dashboard based on personal preferences.
Command Example: “Activate my driving profile,” or “Set the car for my evening commute.”

2. One-Touch Passenger Control

Use Case: Passengers can adjust their comfort settings (lighting, seat position, temperature) via their phone or voice, without affecting the driver.
Key Features:
Individual control zones for each passenger (e.g., rear seat settings).
Voice or text commands for passengers to adjust their space independently.
Command Example: “Passenger 2, set the backseat temperature to 68°F.”

3. Effortless Lighting & Visibility Adjustments

Use Case: Drivers and passengers can control the vehicle's interior and exterior lighting with a simple command, creating the perfect driving ambiance.
Key Features:
Control ambient lighting, headlights, or dashboard illumination via voice.
Adjust brightness or color in real-time without navigating menus.
Command Example: “Dim the dashboard lights,” or “Turn on ambient blue lighting.”

4. Quick and Intuitive ADAS Car Mode Setup

Use Case: Changing levels of assistance (e.g., adaptive cruise control, lane keep assist., or speed limit) should be as easy as speaking a command.
Key Features:
Voice-driven mode selection for quick transitions between different driving settings.
Clear feedback confirming the change without unnecessary prompts.
Command Example: “Activate sport mode but keep the adaptive cruise control.” >  a result will be shown on the dashboard.

5. Minimal Interaction for Maximum Simplicity

Use Case: Minimize the need to interact with the infotainment system by relying solely on voice for settings that don't require visual input.
Key Features:
Natural language processing that understands simple and direct requests.
Reducing the need for touchscreen or physical controls.
Command Example: “Open the sunroof halfway,” or “Close all windows.”

Why This Approach?
Philosophy: The project operates on the belief that driving should be simple and joyful, without unnecessary complexities. Drivers shouldn’t have to relearn how to interact with every car they use, especially with essential settings like temperature, lighting, and mirrors.
Focus on Car Settings: While routing, navigation, and entertainment are handled by systems like Apple CarPlay or Android Auto, this platform focuses on improving in-car settings control, ensuring that every interaction is smooth and stress-free.
"Golf Cart Simplicity": The system should offer the effortlessness of a golf cart—you get in, and the car just works as you need it to, with minimal interaction and complexity. The goal is to cut through layers of menus and provide a more direct, user-friendly experience.
